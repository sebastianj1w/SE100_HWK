# Vue

## What is Vue

Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other heavyweight frameworks, Vue uses ***bottom-up incremental design***. Vue's core libraries ***focus only on the view layer and are very easy to learn and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.*** On the other hand, Vue is fully capable of driving complex single-page applications using single-file components and libraries supported by the Vue ecosystem.

The goal of Vue.js is to implement the response data binding and composite view components through the simplest API.

## Pros & Cons

What I've written above comes from the internet, it looks like a bit of a sham, and then it's my real feeling in learning.

### 1.Easy to use

People who only know some knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS can get to Vue quickly. As for me, I got confused when I try to use other frameworks of front-end development, but I felt comfort to learn Vue.

### 2.Lightweight

The author uses a very compact kernel to build Vue.

## Cons

### 2.x
